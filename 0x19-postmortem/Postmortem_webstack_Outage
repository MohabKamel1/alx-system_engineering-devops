# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on June 6, 2024

## Issue Summary

**Duration:**  
June 6, 2024, from 14:30 to 16:00 UTC

**Impact:**  
Our primary e-commerce platform experienced a significant outage, rendering the website inaccessible to users. Approximately 80% of our user base was affected, resulting in an inability to browse products, place orders, or access account information. Customer support also saw a 300% increase in ticket volume during the outage.

**Root Cause:**  
A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused an infinite loop of traffic redirection, leading to server overload and eventual crash.

## Timeline

- **14:30** - Issue detected via automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server errors and dropped requests.
- **14:32** - Engineers begin investigation by checking server logs and monitoring dashboard.
- **14:40** - Initial assumption was a DDoS attack due to high traffic patterns; mitigations for DDoS were deployed.
- **14:50** - DDoS mitigations proved ineffective; traffic patterns did not match typical attack signatures.
- **15:00** - Escalated to network infrastructure team for deeper analysis.
- **15:15** - Network team identified abnormal traffic routing patterns; load balancer configurations were reviewed.
- **15:30** - Discovered misconfiguration in the load balancer settings causing traffic loop.
- **15:45** - Load balancer configuration corrected and servers restarted.
- **16:00** - Services fully restored and normal traffic resumed.

## Root Cause and Resolution

### Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a recent update to the load balancer configuration. A new routing rule intended to optimize traffic distribution inadvertently created a loop, causing each incoming request to be continuously redirected between servers. This resulted in rapid resource exhaustion and server crashes.

### Resolution:
Once the misconfiguration was identified, the load balancer settings were promptly corrected by removing the erroneous rule. A systematic server restart followed to ensure all systems returned to normal operation. Traffic monitoring confirmed that the loop was resolved and servers were handling requests correctly.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

### Improvements:
- Enhance load balancer configuration change review process.
- Increase redundancy and failover capabilities for critical routing components.
- Improve monitoring to detect unusual traffic patterns more swiftly.

### Tasks:
1. **Implement Load Balancer Configuration Audits:**
   - Establish a mandatory peer-review process for any changes to load balancer settings.
   - Develop automated scripts to validate configurations before deployment.

2. **Expand Monitoring Capabilities:**
   - Add specific alerts for unusual traffic redirection patterns.
   - Deploy synthetic monitoring to simulate user interactions and detect accessibility issues.

3. **Increase Redundancy:**
   - Set up secondary load balancers to take over in case of primary load balancer failure.
   - Conduct failover tests quarterly to ensure seamless transitions.

4. **Conduct Training:**
   - Train engineers on identifying and responding to traffic-related issues.
   - Regularly update training materials to reflect new insights and best practices.

By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar outages and ensure a more resilient and reliable service for our users.
